# Advent of Code 2024

This package contains my solutons for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles. The project is written in Swift and uses Swift Argument Parser to expose a command line interface which can be used to run each solution.

## Usage

This project uses the Swift Package Manager, and requires a Swift 6 toolchain to build. With a recent version of Xcode (16.0 and up), you should be able to install dependencies and run the CLI with the following command:

```shell
% swift run adventofcode day1 Inputs/day1.txt
```
